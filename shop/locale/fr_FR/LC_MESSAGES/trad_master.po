"Far from the major international institutions, the African diaspora remains "
"the first donor of the  continent. In 2015, the equivalent of $ 35 billion "
"was transferred in the form of remittances by expatriate African communities "
"to their relatives who remained in the countries of origin. A valuable "
"windfall, but part of the value of which remains confiscated upstream due to "
"high commissions, which can easily exceed the 10% threshold. Sometimes 15%. "
