                                        Familov.com is only an intermediate, between you as consumer and the Shop. Seen the low income we gain from each order, we must charge for the use of an online payment method. The costs cover the technical maintenance of the online payments, the transaction costs that banks charge and our administrative costs for processing payments.All websites charge these costs but they often directly add them to the sending and/or administrative costs. We choose to separate these costs so that only the customers willing to use an online payment method have to pay them. We thank you for your understanding.</p>

                                        <p>Familov.com is only an intermediate, between you as consumer and the Shop. Seen the low income we gain from each order, we must charge for the use of an online payment method. The costs cover the technical maintenance of the online payments, the transaction costs that banks charge and our administrative costs for processing payments.All websites charge these costs but they often directly add them to the sending and/or administrative costs. We choose to separate these costs so that only the customers willing to use an online payment method have to pay them. We thank you for your understanding.</p>

                                        <p>If you think the online payment has failed, always check if you have received a confirmation email. This email will enable you to see if your order has been submitted and if the order is already paid for or not.
The confirmation email is directly sent once the payment is complete. This may take a little longer if the payment is being processed by the bank, the credit card company or any other payment company. This can take up to 15 minutes.
If after 15 minutes you still have no confirmation email in your inbox, contact our customer service. They will tell you if the order and the payment have succeeded.</p>
